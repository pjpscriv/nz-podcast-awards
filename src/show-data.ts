So how do we do it well? I reckon we can do it with a bit of gorgeousness and gusto and break that ‘getting old’ mould just a little. Or maybe more than a little. So join me as we climb into some of those topics that just aren't so clear-cut, maybe are a little chewy, a little crunchy… and let’s journey our way through them. I've got a group of wonderful wāhine, and the odd beaut bloke, to chat with, and we're going to share some wisdom that we've discovered along the way. And I’d love for you to share your wisdom with me too, because everybody has something to offer."

After the emergence of more victims and a six-year legal battle, Wallace was convicted of multiple crimes, no longer able to keep name suppression and stripped of his knighthood. The case raised major legal questions about the justice system, its treatment of abuse victims and name suppression laws. It also forced the arts sector to examine whether it had turned a blind eye to Wallace’s offending, in return for millions of dollars worth of patronage. Featuring new in-depth interviews, including Wallace’s only media interview since conviction, this is the story of his rise and fall, crimes and punishment - and his survivors."
